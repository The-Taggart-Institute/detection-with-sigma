# 2.7 :: Review

Okay! That was a lot. Give yourself a moment to go touch some grass and think about what you've done.

Back already? Let's review. Here is what we've done so far:

1. Learned about the structure of Sigma rules
2. Manually converted a few rules ourselves
3. Built a framework for using Sigma CLI to convert rules automatically
4. Learned what pySigma pipelines are for
5. Learned how pipelines are structured and even tested some ourselves
6. Implemented converted rules into Splunk with proper transformation
7. Built our own post processing pipeline to build our own custom output format

You should be proud of yourself! Our foundation has been set and we're ready to really start automating. Much of what you've done already you may never need to do again, but this wouldn't be a course if you didn't learn a few things along the way.

**TODO**: Give the student a pipeline that they'll be using for future content here. Let them modify it if they would like **
