## Placeholders

Placeholder are one of the concepts in Sigma that can really shine when used in an enterprise environment. Placeholders can take an item in a rule and expand it to be some other much more complicated expression.

Take the following rule:

```yaml
title: RDP Originating From Domain Controller

While reading this you may wonder "what does `Computer|expand: '%domain_controller_hostnames%'` do"? Well, without a corresponding transformation in your pipeline, it will do nothing more than leave you a nice error message. We have a few ways to ahndle this
